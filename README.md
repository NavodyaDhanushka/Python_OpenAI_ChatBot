Python_OpenAI_ChatBot


A Python OpenAI ChatBot is a program that uses OpenAI's AI models to simulate natural conversations with users. This project demonstrates how to create a chatbot using Python and the OpenAI API, leveraging the powerful gpt-3.5-turbo model to generate human-like responses.

The chatbot works by processing user input, sending it to OpenAI's API, and returning an AI-generated response in real-time. It supports dynamic conversations and can be customized for various applications, such as answering questions, providing recommendations, or assisting with customer support.

This project includes:

Integration of the OpenAI API with Python.
Configuration of the gpt-3.5-turbo model for generating responses.
A simple interface for user interaction.
Error handling to manage API limits and exceptions.
The chatbot is designed to be lightweight, easy to set up, and highly customizable for different conversational needs.
